### App Idea: Shift Management App for Student Workers

An app designed to help student workers balance their work hours with their class schedules while ensuring fairness in scheduling and adequate coverage for shifts. This app would make scheduling more efficient, transparent, and tailored to each student’s availability. Key features would include:

- [ ] Class Schedule Integration: Allow students to input their class schedules, automatically blocking out the times they are unavailable for work. This ensures no overlap between work hours and class commitments.
- [ ] Fair Shift Distribution: The app could use algorithms to assign shifts based on availability, ensuring that each student worker receives a fair number of hours per week while considering seniority, preferred shifts, or other factors like availability or experience. This helps avoid any employee getting too many or too few hours.
- [ ] Real-Time Availability Updates: Students can update their availability in real-time based on changes to their class schedules, personal plans, or other obligations. The app will automatically adjust the schedule to reflect these updates.
- [ ] Shift Swap & Request: If a student is unable to work a shift, they can easily request a swap with another worker who is available. Admins can approve swaps to ensure coverage and fairness.
- [ ] Auto-Generated Weekly Schedule: The app will generate a weekly work schedule that ensures shifts are equally distributed, factoring in student workers’ preferred working hours and overall availability.
- [ ] Push Notifications & Reminders: Send notifications to students about their upcoming shifts and any updates or changes to the schedule. This will help prevent no-shows or confusion about work hours.
- [ ] Performance Tracking: Track and display each worker’s hours over the course of the semester, ensuring that no one is overworked and everyone gets their fair share of shifts.
- [ ] Manager/Admin Dashboard: A centralized dashboard for managers to review schedules, track worker availability, monitor hours worked, and approve shift swaps. Managers could also use this dashboard to adjust the balance of hours worked and provide additional shifts as needed.
- [ ] Fairness Metrics: Implement a fairness algorithm to ensure that shifts are distributed equitably. For instance, the system could keep track of how many hours each worker has received and automatically offer shifts to those with fewer hours when new ones become available.

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:

This was my first time working with Xcode and Swift, so just getting everything set up took a bit longer than I expected. Once I got it up and running, I had to spend some time figuring out the folder structure and what each file was actually for. It was a little overwhelming at first, but after playing around with the tools and testing the app on the simulators, everything started to click. Honestly, I had a lot of fun with this project, and now I’m really excited to take on even more challenging ones in the future.
